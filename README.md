# Pressure-Detection


## Description

* Pressure-Detection Function Is To Detect High Pressure in a Plane Cabin. If High Pressure Detected , It Raises Alarm 
  Which Is Turnning On Led For 60 Seconds.
* Design of this project based on UML Diagrams.

## Project Design

* To Efficiently Design This System I Go Through These Design Stages : 
  * Case Study
  * Design Method
  * Requirements
  * Space Exploration/Partioning
  * System Analysis
  * System Design
  
 1- Case Study
 
  * A Client Expects To Deliver The Software of The Following System :
  
    * Specifications :
      * Detection System which Informs The Crew Of a Cabin With An Alarm When Pressure Exceeding 20 Bars In The Cabin
      * The Alarm Duration Equals 60 Seconds
      * Keep Track Of The Measured Values 
      
    * Assumptions :
      * The controller set up and shutdown procedures are not modeled
      * The controller maintenance is not modeled
      * The pressure sensor never fails
      * The alarm never fails
      * The controller never faces power cut
      * Versioning  The ”keep Track Of Measured Value”  Option is not Modeled in The First Version Of The Design
      
  2- Design Method :
  
    * I used Water Fall Design Method
